    "* `optimizer`: an `optax` optimizer used for training\n",
    "* `evaluator`: the `Evaluator` to use during self-play, we initialized ours using `AlphaZero(MCTS)`\n",

    "* `extract_model_params_fn`: (Optional) in special cases we need to define how to extract all model parameters from a flax `TrainState`. The default function handles BatchNorm, but if another special-case technique applied across batches is used (e.g. Dropout) we would need to define a function to extract the appropriate parameters. You usually won't need to define this!\n",
