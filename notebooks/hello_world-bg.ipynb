    "Now that we have all the proper pieces defined, we are ready to initialize a Trainer and start training!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Trainer` takes many parameters, so let's walk through them all:\n",
    "* `batch_size`: # of parallel environments used to collect self-play games\n",
    "* `train_batch_size`: size of minibatch used during training step\n",
    "* `warmup_steps`: # of steps (per batch) to collect via self-play prior to entering the training loop. This is used to populate the replay memory with some initial samples\n",
    "* `collection_steps_per_epoch`: # of steps (per batch) to collect via self-play per epoch\n",
    "* `train_steps_per_epoch`: # of train steps per epoch\n",
    "* `nn`: neural network (`linen.Module`)\n",
    "* `loss_fn`: loss function used for training, we use a provided default loss which implements the loss function used in the `AlphaZero` paper\n",
    "* `optimizer`: an `optax` optimizer used for training\n",
    "* `evaluator`: the `Evaluator` to use during self-play, we initialized ours using `AlphaZero(MCTS)`\n",
    "* `memory_buffer`: the memory buffer used to store samples from self-play games, we  initialized ours using `EpisodeReplayBuffer`\n",
    "* `max_episode_steps`: maximum number of steps/turns to allow before truncating an episode\n",
    "* `env_step_fn`: environment step function (we defined ours above)\n",
    "* `env_init_fn`: environment init function (we defined ours above)\n",
    "* `state_to_nn_input_fn`: function to convert environment state to nn input (we defined ours above)\n",
    "* `testers`: any number of `Tester`s, used to evaluate a given model and take their own parameters. We'll use the two evaluators defined above to initialize two Testers.\n",
    "* `evaluator_test`: (Optional) Evaluator used within Testers. By default used `evaluator`, but sometimes you may want to test with a larger MCTS iteration budget for example, or a different move sampling temperature\n",
    "* `data_transform_fns`: (optional) list of data transform functions to apply to self-play experiences (e.g. rotation, reflection, etc.)\n",
    "* `extract_model_params_fn`: (Optional) in special cases we need to define how to extract all model parameters from a flax `TrainState`. The default function handles BatchNorm, but if another special-case technique applied across batches is used (e.g. Dropout) we would need to define a function to extract the appropriate parameters. You usually won't need to define this!\n",
    "* `wandb_project_name`: (Optional) Weights and Biases project name. You will be prompted to login if a name is provided. If a name is provided, a run will be initialized and loss and other metrics will be logged to the given wandb project.\n",
    "* `ckpt_dir`: (Optional) directory to store checkpoints in, by default this is set to `/tmp/turbozero_checkpoints`\n",
    "* `max_checkpoints`: (Optional) maximum number of most-recent checkpoints to retain (default: 2)\n",
    "* `num_devices`: (Optional) number of hardware accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) to use. If not given, all available hardware accelerators are used\n",
    "* `wandb_run`: (Optional) continues from an initialized `wandb` run if provided, otherwise a new one is initialized\n",
    "* `extra_wandb_config`: (Optional) any extra metadata to store in the `wandb` run config\n",
    "\n",
